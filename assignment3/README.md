## Kubernetes, Docker, Containerisation and Virtualisation

1. What is a hypervisor and where does it sit in the server virtualisation stack?
2. What is a container runtime and name the two most common runtimes?

## Linux administration and shell scripting
1. Use just one command to create a directory structure where the directory sports contains a directory called footballteams which itself contains africanteam which itself contains pwdkumba.
2. Use the tree command to display your directory structure.
3. Research the following linux commands
    a) grep
    b) sed

## CICD, Git, GitHub, GitHub Action, Infrastructure as as Code (IaC), Terraform, Packer and Ansible
1. You create a repository in GitHub called <b>myfirstrepo</b>. You then clone this repository on your local laptop. On your laptop how would you check its remote address? How would you go about changing the remote address so that it points to repository called <b>mysecondrepo</b>?
2. You have a workflow running on GitHub Action that has the following code;
```
jobs:
  deploy_to_production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy to production with soruce code
    steps:
      - name: Checkout GitHub Action
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Login via Azure CLI
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: deploy to production step with soruce code
        uses: azure/spring-cloud-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          use-staging-deployment: false
          package: ${{ env.ASC_PACKAGE_PATH }}
```
Describe what you think this code is doing.



## System Architecture and Application Design, Cloud Computing (AWS)
1. You have worked thus far with systems that you have had to download and install on your local laptop as well as systems hosted remotely on some external cloud. Describe in details the features and capabilities of all the systems (local and remote) that you have worked with thus far on this training. Draw a solution architecture diagram depicting these systems and where they fit in your solution landscape.
2. For all the systems that you have installed locally, write a manual for its installation and configuration.
3. In a general manner describe would you would interact with AWS account
4. AWS provide a public and a private area in which you could deploy your services. In which of these would you deploy the following services?
    a) EC2 instances
    b) DynamoDB databases
    c) VPC network
    d) S3 buckets
    e) IAM users


## Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Troubleshooting, Observability

1. Research on what APM (application programming monitoring)
2. What is a system metric and why might it be useful to collect metrics?
3. What is an system log and why might you want to collect logs?
