## CICD, Infrastructure as as Code (IaC), Terraform, Packer and Ansible


1. A simple three-tier java based application is deployed across two availability zones(AZ) on a Tomcat server. The application uses a self-managed PostgresQL database as its persistence layer and Nginx as its web server. The application is not required to be highly resilient nor be capable of elastic behaviour.

*  Describe how you might build this environment manually from the tool chain you are familiar with.
*  Describe how you might build this environment from an automated provisioning pipeline from the tool chain you are familiar with.

2. Considering question 1 above, how would you re-design the application so that it is both elastic and highly available across the three tiers?

3. Describe how you would use Maven to build a java application
